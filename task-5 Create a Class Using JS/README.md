# Task 5: Adding Tasks

## Description

For this task, we'll be creating a class to manage the tasks, adding a method to the class to keep track of tasks in our application, and connecting up the **New Task** form to create tasks.

## Walkthrough

### Step 1: The Setup

In this step, we'll re-organise our folder structure in preparation for the next few steps.

1. Create a `js` folder in your project if one does not already exist
2. Copy the existing js file into your `js` folder, and rename it to `index.js`
3. Update the `<script>` tag in your `html` file to use the new location of the `js/index.js` file.
4.  Create a `taskManager.js` file in the `js` folder
5. Add a `<script>` tag pointing to the `js/taskManager.js` file _before_ the `<script>` tag pointing to the `js/index.js` file.
